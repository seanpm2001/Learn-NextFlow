// About:
// I decided to make NextFlow the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-NextFlow) as NextFlow is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the NextFlow programming language. It only makes sense to NextFlow the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
